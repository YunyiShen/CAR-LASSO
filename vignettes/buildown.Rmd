```
We also offer two low level one-step sampling functions `rCARAlasso_` and `rCARlasso_` for adaptive and non-adaptive version of the CARlasso, see [reference](https://yunyishen.ml/CAR-LASSO/dev/reference/rCARAlasso_.html) for the detail.

The typical usage would be one write ones own sampler to sample the Normal latent variable and feed it to the one-step sampling. Note that these two functions will **update** the current states in **memory** directly.
