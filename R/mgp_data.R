#' Gut microbiota in the Irish Elderly
#'
#' This study is based on pyrosequencing of 16S rDNA amplicons from faecal samples collected from 178 elderly Irish citizens and 13 healthy young control subjects. A subset of these samples were also subjected to shotgun sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2000 2x91bp reads. Antibiotic treatment was an exclusion criterion.
